# My-Reads

## About
This is the first project for the Udacity React Nanodegree. This project emphasizes the use of React with a given API server. The starter template contains the CSS and HTML for the project but omits the React code. I was able to build the React components to populate the main page and search page with books. THe main page has three shelves that users are able to move the books between shelves. The search page allows users to search for new books to add to their shelves. After selecting books to add to shelves, when you navigate back to the home page the you can instantly see the selections made on the search page. This project uses React's setState to build the functionality to move books from one shelf to another.

A [React.js]() bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

#### Main Page
 The main page shows 3 shelves for books.

 The main page shows a control that allows users to move books between shelves. The control should be tied to each book instance.

 When the browser is refreshed, the same information is displayed on the page.

#### Search Page
 The search page has a search input field. As the user types into the search field, books that match the query are displayed on the page.
 Search results on the search page allow the user to select “currently reading”, “want to read”, or “read” to place the book in a certain shelf.
 When an item is categorized on the search page, and the user navigates to the main page, it appears on that shelf in the main page.
